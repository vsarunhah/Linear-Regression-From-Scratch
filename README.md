# Linear Regression From Scratch
A project where I learned about linear regression from scratch, understanding the formulae and math behind how univariate linear regression works in python.
I used bike sharing data from a company to predict it's future sales, whilst understanding how a loss function is minimized while avoiding
heavy calculus for univariate regression.
